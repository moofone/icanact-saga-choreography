//! Participant deduplication storage for idempotent SAGA processing.
//!
//! This module provides deduplication infrastructure that enables participant
//! services to safely process the same message multiple times without
//! side effects. This is critical in distributed systems because:
//!
//! - Messages may be redelivered due to network issues
//! - At-least-once delivery semantics require idempotent handlers
//! - Retry logic may cause duplicate attempts
//!
//! In the choreography-based SAGA pattern, each participant must be able to
//! determine if it has already processed a given request to maintain exactly-once
//! semantics despite the possibility of duplicate message delivery.

use super::SagaId;

/// A trait for participant deduplication storage implementations.
///
/// The deduplication store tracks which operations have already been processed
/// for each SAGA, enabling idempotent message handling. This is essential for:
///
/// - Preventing duplicate transaction execution
/// - Ensuring compensation actions aren't applied multiple times
/// - Maintaining exactly-once processing semantics
///
/// Implementations should provide persistent storage with appropriate TTLs
/// for production use. The store should survive process restarts to handle
/// redelivered messages after crashes.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All implementations must be `Send + Sync + 'static` as stores are typically
/// shared across async tasks.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let dedupe = InMemoryDedupe::new();
/// let saga_id = SagaId::new(1);
/// let operation_key = "reserve_inventory";
///
/// // Check and mark atomically - returns true if this is a new operation
/// if dedupe.check_and_mark(saga_id, operation_key)? {
///     // First time processing - execute the operation
///     execute_operation()?;
/// } else {
///     // Already processed - skip or return cached result
/// }
/// ```
