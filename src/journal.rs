//! Participant journal storage for SAGA event persistence.
//!
//! This module provides the journaling infrastructure that enables participant
//! services to durably record events related to SAGA orchestrations. Journaling
//! is essential for:
//!
//! - **Recovery**: Reconstructing participant state after failures
//! - **Audit**: Maintaining a complete history of actions taken
//! - **Compensation**: Enabling proper rollback by tracking what was done
//!
//! In the choreography-based SAGA pattern, each participant maintains its own
//! journal of events, allowing for independent recovery and replay.

use super::{ParticipantEvent, SagaId};

/// A trait for participant journal storage implementations.
///
/// The journal provides durable, append-only storage for events that occur
/// during SAGA execution. This enables participants to:
///
/// - Record events as they happen for recovery purposes
/// - Replay events to reconstruct state after a crash
/// - Query which SAGAs have been processed by this participant
///
/// Implementations should ensure atomicity of append operations and durability
/// of stored events. For production use, consider implementations backed by
/// databases or persistent message queues.
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All implementations must be `Send + Sync + 'static` as journals are typically
/// shared across async tasks.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let journal = InMemoryJournal::new();
/// let saga_id = SagaId::new(1);
///
/// // Record an event
/// journal.append(saga_id, ParticipantEvent::Started)?;
///
/// // Read back all events for a saga
/// let entries = journal.read(saga_id)?;
/// ```
